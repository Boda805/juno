title: Feeder Gateway Connection
---

For the feeder Gateway, we will need to create a client, we should base on [this](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/services/api/feeder_gateway/feeder_gateway_client.py)
maybe and the methods called there.

Once we have a Gateway Client, we should be able to get to connect to these endpoints:
- get_contract_addresses
- call_contract
- get_block
- get_state_update
- get_code
- get_full_contract
- get_storage_at
- get_transaction_status
- get_transaction
- get_transaction_receipt
- get_block_hash_by_id
- get_block_id_by_hash
- get_transaction_hash_by_id
- get_transaction_id_by_hash

This should be implemented gradually, in the beginning, for the interaction with the Layer 1 and Starknet State, we will
only need:
- get_contract_addresses

For the contract interaction, and since what block we should start to check the Layer 1 chain.
